      "body": "I just finished my first read of the draft and it feels like the overall concept makes a lot of sense as a general approach for credential type metadata! The main thing I was wondering about when reading the draft was if this is really necessary for every credential or if sometimes only providing some kind of schema information would be sufficient.\r\n\r\nDo you think it makes sense to also allow an option where the `vct` claim directly references a schema (perhaps including the integrity information)? This could be a lightweight version where the credential issuer will not provide additional metadata but wants to convey at least the schema (most likely an external URL). ",

      "body": "A couple of things I spotted about the example:\r\n\r\n1. I think it's defining a credential for all Betelgeuse universities, but the example logo implies it's only for a single university: \"https://exampleuniversity.com/public/logo.png\" - \"https://betelgeuse.example.com/education-logo.png\" might be better\r\n2. There isn't a logo defined for de-DE, which seems inconsistent with Section 7 (\"Display Metadata\") as there are claim display names defined for de-DE: \"The object MUST contain a property for each language that is supported by the type\"\r\n3. The vct of \"https://betelgeuse.example.com/identity_credential\" - I'm not sure 'identity_credential' is a good description for the contents, maybe \"https://betelgeuse.example.com/degree_credential\" is better (I think it's not an identity credential with an optional degree, because if it was the name would be authoritative and it would probably allow multiple degrees to be listed)\r\n4. The formatting is a bit messed up in the rendered example in general as there's a mixture of spaces/tabs\r\n",
